    Link to an outside website with an absolute link.
<h2>Absolute Link</h2>
    Explain the difference between an absolute link and a relative link. Why would you use relative links?
    A absolut link is a complete URL (http, https), domain name, and path to specific resource.
<h2>Relative links</h2>
    They don't have a full URL only path to resources. this makes them more flexible in the website without changing out of it.
