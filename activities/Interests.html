            <p>So I love to workout! I'm currently engaged and prepsring for a wedding, but I was always into sports and fitness. The reason why I love to workout weather it is sports or weights is because it has always been a part of my life, but more recently I value my health so much more because of my mission I served back in 2020. I served in oakland california (tongan Speaking). It was amazing but during my time I gain weight over a 100lb or 45kgs. This was due to my diet and eating what every the members made for us. I understood that many are sacrificing a lot for us and it would be disrespectful to deny their efforts. so I ate and ate. After coming home I found that I was able to lose it all and some in trying to achieve my goals. In doing so I learned to love myself and learned to appreciate my body and the importance to being healthy. </p>
            <p>I also love to eat! which is why It was important to me to be healthy. One of my favorite hobbies is a combination of the 2. Free diving! Since I was a little kid the I loved the ocean and diving became a way I spent most of my time in it. This is because of a rule my dad taught us. <blockquote>"you can eat what you catch"-<strong>Elias Akinaka</strong></blockquote> I became so excited and the better I became at it the more I could eat and the long I spent in the water!</p>
