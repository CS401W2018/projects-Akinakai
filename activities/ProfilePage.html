            <p>Aloha, A little about me is that I come from a huge family. I have 6 other siblings and we all grew up on the greatest island of Hawaii, Maui. I'm currently a college student and studing computer science and it is something that I'm super stoked about. The most important thing to remember about me is I'm a child of God.</p>   
            <p>A couple of my current interest is Diving and overall health. I served a mission for the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints and it was the best thing I could have done between 2020 - 2022. But during this time I gain a unhealthy amount of weight. I had gain over 110 pounds or 49kg! I know super bad, but now that it has been about 2 years I have lost a health 128lbs or 58kgs. I plan on continuing on this journey. I've put a list down below of my over all top 3. </p>
